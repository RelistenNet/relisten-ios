/**
 * A collection of references to a document from some kind of numbered entity (either a targetID or
 * batchID). As references are added to or removed from the set corresponding events are emitted to
 * a registered garbage collector.
 *
 * Each reference is represented by a FSTDocumentReference object. Each of them contains enough
 * information to uniquely identify the reference. They are all stored primarily in a set sorted
 * by key. A document is considered garbage if there's no references in that set (this can be
 * efficiently checked thanks to sorting by key).
 *
 * FSTReferenceSet also keeps a secondary set that contains references sorted by IDs. This one is
 * used to efficiently implement removal of all references by some target ID.
