/**
 * An FSTStream is an abstract base class that represents a restartable streaming RPC to the
 * Firestore backend. It's built on top of GRPC's own support for streaming RPCs, and adds several
 * critical features for our clients:
 *
 *   - Restarting a stream is allowed (after failure)
 *   - Exponential backoff on failure (independent of the underlying channel)
 *   - Authentication via CredentialsProvider
 *   - Dispatching all callbacks into the shared worker queue
 *
 * Subclasses of FSTStream implement serialization of models to and from bytes (via protocol
 * buffers) for a specific streaming RPC and emit events specific to the stream.
 *
 * ## Starting and Stopping
 *
 * Streaming RPCs are stateful and need to be started before messages can be sent and received.
 * The FSTStream will call its delegate's specific streamDidOpen method once the stream is ready
 * to accept requests.
 *
 * Should a `start` fail, FSTStream will call its delegate's specific streamDidClose method with an
 * NSError indicating what went wrong. The delegate is free to call start again.
 *
 * An FSTStream can also be explicitly stopped which indicates that the caller has discarded the
 * stream and no further events should be emitted. Once explicitly stopped, a stream cannot be
 * restarted.
 *
 * ## Subclassing Notes
 *
 * An implementation of FSTStream needs to implement the following methods:
 *   - `createRPCWithRequestsWriter`, should create the specific RPC (a GRPCCall object).
 *   - `handleStreamMessage`, receives protocol buffer responses from GRPC and must deserialize and
 *     delegate to some stream specific response method.
 *   - `notifyStreamOpen`, should call through to the stream-specific streamDidOpen method.
 *   - `notifyStreamInterrupted`, calls through to the stream-specific streamWasInterrupted method.
 *
 * Additionally, beyond these required methods, subclasses will want to implement methods that
 * take request models, serialize them, and write them to using writeRequest:. Implementation
 * specific cleanup logic can be added to tearDown:.
 *
 * ## RPC Message Type
 *
 * FSTStream intentionally uses the GRPCCall interface to GRPC directly, bypassing both GRPCProtoRPC
 * and GRXBufferedPipe for sending data. This has been done to avoid race conditions that come out
 * of a loosely specified locking contract on GRXWriter. There's essentially no way to safely use
 * any of the wrapper objects for GRXWriter (that perform buffering or conversion to/from protos).
 *
 * See https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/10957 for the kinds of things we're trying to avoid.
