        depends on the initially requested, _pre-mutation_ method of a request. All other configuration properties

      Adds a closure that can modify HTTP headers, body, etc. before a `Request` is created. Use this to configure
      generic HTTP behavior not configurable via the `headers` property, such as a header that contains a nonce or a
      cryptographic digest of the request body.

      - Note: These mutations are applied _after_ any ad hoc mutation provided via the `requestMutation:` parameter of
          `Resource.request(...)`. This is because Siesta requests get their body from `requestMutation:`, and
          configured mutations often want to inspect (or even alter) that body.

      - Note: Configuration depends on HTTP request method, but configured mutations can also _alter_ the request method.
          Siesta will use the HTTP method of the pre-mutation request to determine what configuration to use for _all_
          mutations, and then use the post-mutation HTTP method for any further configuration.
