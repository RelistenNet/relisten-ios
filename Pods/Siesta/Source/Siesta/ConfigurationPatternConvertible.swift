  A type that can serve as a URL matcher for service configuration.

  Siesta provides implementations of this protocol for `String` (for glob-based matching) and `Resource` (to configure
  one specific resource).

  - SeeAlso: `String.configurationPattern(for:)`

    /**
      Matches URLs using shell-like wildcards / globs.

      The `urlPattern` is interpreted relative to the service’s base URL unless it begins with a protocol (e.g. `http:`).
      If it is relative, the leading slash is optional.

      The pattern supports three wildcards:

      - `*` matches zero or more characters within a path segment.
      - `**` matches zero or more characters across path segments, with the special case that `/​**​/` matches `/`.
      - `?` matches exactly one character within a path segment, and thus `?*` matches one or more.

      Examples:

      - `/foo/​*​/bar` matches `/foo/1/bar` and `/foo/123/bar`.
      - `/foo/​**​/bar` matches `/foo/bar`, `/foo/123/bar`, and `/foo/1/2/3/bar`.
      - `/foo*​/bar` matches `/foo/bar` and `/food/bar`.
      - `/foo/​​*` matches `/foo/123` and `/foo/`.
      - `/foo/?*` matches `/foo/123` but _not_ `/foo/`.

      The pattern ignores the resource’s query string.
