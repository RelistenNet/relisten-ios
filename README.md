# Getting Started

If you'd like to build Relisten iOS you'll need [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org). 

Clone the repository, then run the setup script to make sure you have all of the dependencies checked out (they'll check out one directory up from your relisten-ios checkout)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/RelistenNet/relisten-ios.git
$ cd relisten-ios
$ ./setup.sh
$ open Relisten.xcworkspace
```
