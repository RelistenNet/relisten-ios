- Lots of bug fixes and new features to play around with!
- Audio playback in bluetooth situations should be much improved.
- Lock screen controls are much improved

- Welcome @farktronix to the dev team! He is responsible for many of these new features and bug fixes.

NOTE: favorites/my library functionality has been removed. The UI will be removed in a future beta. This feature will come back in a couple months but I would like to release a stable version without this feature.
